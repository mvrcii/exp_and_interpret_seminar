# Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG) Feature Extraction

## Overview
The Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG) is a feature descriptor used in computer vision and image processing for the purpose of object detection. This repository contains an implementation of HOG feature extraction in Python, demonstrated on images of cats. The HOG descriptor focuses on the structure or the shape of an object. It works by dividing the image into small connected regions called cells, and for the pixels within each cell, a histogram of gradient directions or edge orientations is compiled.

## Visualizations
This repository includes visualizations of the HOG feature extraction process:

- The original grayscale image.
- Zoomed-in views of individual cells within the image, showing gradient orientations and magnitudes.
- A representation of the full HOG descriptor with vector fields indicating the predominant directions of gradients within each cell.

In the above visualization, we see the original grayscale image alongside the full HOG descriptor representation. Each arrow within the HOG descriptor image corresponds to a gradient orientation within a particular cell of the image. The length of the arrow represents the magnitude of the gradient in that direction.

### Zoomed-in Cell Visualizations
Here are zoomed-in visualizations of individual cells, showing the gradients and the HOG representation for different types of edges within the image.

#### Vertical Edges

#### Circular Edges

Each zoomed-in view provides a detailed look at how gradients are calculated and represented in the HOG descriptor. These visualizations help in understanding the nature of the feature vectors generated by the HOG descriptor.

## Implementation Details
The implementation is done using Python, utilizing libraries such as OpenCV for image processing, NumPy for numerical operations, and Matplotlib for visualizations. The steps involved in the process are:

1. Convert the image to grayscale.
2. Calculate the gradients in the x and y directions.
3. Compute the gradient magnitudes and orientations.
4. Divide the image into cells and, for each cell, compile a histogram based on the orientations and magnitudes.
5. Normalize the histograms to enhance invariance to lighting variations.

The Jupyter notebook `hog_feature_extraction.ipynb` included in this repository walks through the code, providing a step-by-step explanation of the HOG feature extraction process.
